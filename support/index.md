## Contact

Whether you have a technical question about the API that isn't answered by the documentation, or maybe have an idea but you're not quite sure how to build it into a viable product, we're always happy to do what we can to support good projects.

We're also keen to hear what you think and what suggestions you may have to improve the Labs site and of course our API. 

### Keep in touch

We have several ways that you can keep up to date with news from Europeana Labs, and also get in touch with us to ask questions.

* **Want to get regular news from Europeana Labs?**  
Our e-newsletter is sent every few months to all developers and those who have opted to subscribe. There’s an opt-out link at the bottom of every email.
* **Want more immediate news and a place to talk with fellow API users?**  
We will now be using our API forum to provide up to date news, as well as encouraging you to post your questions. It’s also the place where we will announce new features or changes, and any planned disruption to services. Sign up to the API Forum >>>
* **Are you a Twitter user?**  
Follow us at @EuropeanaTech for news, tips and more, or share with us your own news and ideas
* **Need some more direct advice?**  
You can email us at api@europeana.eu (or use our [Online contact form](/support/contact/)) and we’ll make sure that someone in the team gets back to you as soon as possible.
