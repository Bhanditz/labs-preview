Europeana helps you develop your ideas and prototypes into sustainable products by providing access to business development expertise, relevant professional networks and (indirectly) capital. We currently offer these support services within projects like [Europeana Creative](http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-creative) and in specific individual cases.

## Access to expertise

Europeana and its partners deliver the following services:

### Business

- Consultancy services on strategic analysis and development, market research and scoping, business modelling, financial analysis and planning, business plan development, sales and growth strategy
- Business model workshops â€“ we support you with the development of your business model with a well-established workshop method and program. 

- Relevant online resources to help you extend your entrepreneurial expertise and skills (for example, pitching or networking skills). Examples include a list of the best entrepreneur websites (according to forbes.com), such as http://avc.com, http://firstround.com/review, http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/, etc.

### Technical

- Consultancy services on technical models/services/components, including the Europeana API service, content retrieval and re-use, Europeana Data Model (EDM), etc. 
- Access to testing environments ranging from the Europeana API console to external online and [physical labs](/locations) where you can go to experiment, develop, test and build apps. 

### Legal

- Consultancy services on the legal aspects of Europeana data re-use, including the Europeana Content Re-Use Framework (CRF).

A good example of the mix of these services is the [Europeana Creative business incubation support package](http://pro.europeana.eu/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=d70db467-f1aa-464b-b352-293a53f15458&groupId=1538974) which is awarded to each of the Europeana Creative Challenge winners.

## Access to relevant networks

We can connect you to:

- End-users (e.g. educators, designers, etc.) to use, test and receive feedback on your products (particularly valid for applications with crowdsourcing as a core value proposition)
- Peers to look for new project opportunities and/or partners for specific assignments/with specific expertise profile (Europeana API forum and future project space on Labs)
- Cultural heritage institutions to extend your relation beyond that of a content provider-user (e.g. formulate spin-off projects and consulting, deliver and validate products/goods, services);
- Key partner international innovation networks, such as European Business & Innovation Centre Network (EBN) and European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL)

Also, take a look at our [events](http://labs.europeana.eu/events/) section to find innovation and entrepreneurship events where you can meet special guest speakers, leading venture capitalists and fascinating entrepreneurs addressing the most important topics in today's tech/startup landscape.

## Access to capital

We support your search for project/startup funding by:

- Serving as a referral lead to investors, accelerators and crowd-funding platforms. We are currently investigating the best ways to enable faster and easier access to these capital providers. 
- Apps4Europe business lounges - Apps4Europe project aims to turn data based apps into viable businesses. It connects developers with investors during business lounges at app contests across Europe and help the product creators validate their business ideas and potentially get funding to successfully bring them to market. Find and attend a business lounge event near you or apply for the online competition starting September 2014.
