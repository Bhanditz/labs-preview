### What open source tools are you currently working with?

Most of the current development work we’re doing is built using [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database system, and [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) or [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) for indexing. For our metadata projects, such as to support ingestion and metadata enhancement, we’ve been using [Apache Marmotta](http://marmotta.apache.org/) as our triple store, and [ActiveTriples](https://github.com/ActiveTriples/ActiveTriples) to help with modeling RDF objects in Ruby code. We’re also excited to start doing more with [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) and [Hydra](http://projecthydra.org/) as well. We also use [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) for deployment and automation, and [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) for tracking issues.

### What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications?

We’ve used a variety of tools, including [Omeka](http://omeka.org/), [Akara](http://akara.info/), and some of the same previous tools mentioned.

### What are you currently developing? 

All of DPLA’s current public projects are available on [our Github account](https://github.com/dpla). Most of our work has been going towards [Heiðrún](https://digitalpubliclibraryofamerica.atlassian.net/wiki/display/TECH/Heidrun) and [Krikri](https://github.com/dpla/KriKri) (parts of our new metadata ingestion system that’s been under development since October 2014). We’re also just beginning a project, called “[Hydra in a Box](http://dp.la/info/2015/04/15/far-reaching-hydra-in-a-box-joint-initiative-funded-by-imls/)”, with Stanford University and DuraSpace, to develop a turnkey repository system built on the Hydra framework. 

### What would you like to see developed?

Our largest need are high-performance storage and querying solutions for RDF data. We’re particularly excited about work going into [Linked Data Fragments](http://linkeddatafragments.org/), but we’re hoping that there are more implementations that will be under way. We’d also like to see more convergence around developing shared metadata enhancement tools or common APIs for developing them, such as for geocoding and alignment of terms with authority files and vocabularies.
