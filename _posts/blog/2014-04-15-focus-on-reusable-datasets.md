In April we added over 1 million new items to Europeana from Europeâ€™s galleries, libraries, archives and museums. The majority of these new collections are openly licensed and re-usable.

Each month sees a wealth of new content added (we now have over 33 million items available!), so here on Europeana Labs we feature datasets that we think will be of particular interest for re-use. Crucially these will have an open license and direct access to media files.

## Explore the latest datasets

In our [data section](http://labs.europeana.eu/data/ "Europeana Labs Data") each featured dataset has a link to the main site (the Europeana Portal) where you can browse items, filter by your own terms, and follow links to the source material.

Some recent examples include:

## Datasets for API users

Within each [dataset](http://labs.europeana.eu/data/ "Europeana Labs Data") entry you'll also find a link to the API Console, a place to see how API calls are constructed and where you can play around with your own variants to extract custom data.

You'll also find more techniques in our documentation on [Querying Providers and Datasets using the Europeana API](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/provider/)
