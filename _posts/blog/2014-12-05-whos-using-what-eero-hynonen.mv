In this new series "Who's Using What?", [EuropeanaTech](http://pro.europeana.eu/web/network/europeana-tech) Community Manager Gregory Markus from the [Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision](http://www.beeldengeluid.nl/en), will be profiling the use of open source software within the EuropeanaTech Communty and the greater digital cultural heritage world at large. Software will range from storytelling tools that enable reuse to OCRs or libraries and everything in between. Enjoy! 

## Eero Hyvönen

Professor [Eero Hyvönen](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/u/eahyvone/) directs the Semantic Computing Research Group [SeCo](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/) at Aalto Universiy, Finland. Since 2002, a major goal and research theme in SeCo has been creating a national Semantic Web infrastructure in Finland based on ontologies and ontology and data services. In this work, Cultural Heritage Linked Data has been a major application domain and many applications of SeCo are now in use, such as [MuseumFinland](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/museumfinland/); (2004), [CultureSampo](http://www.kulttuurisampo.fi/?lang=en); (2008), [BookSampo](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/applications/kirjasampo/); (2011) of Finnish Public Libraries, and [ONKI](https://onki.fi/)  (2008) [Finto](http://finto.fi/fi/); (2014) ontology service of the National Library of Finland. Using and creating Open Source tools and Linked Open Data has been a long tradition in SeCo. He has published over 300 research articles and books in addition to winning the Semantic Web Challence Award (twice) and several other awards. We are pleased to feature Mr. Eero Hyvönen in our latest addition of "Who's Using What?"

### 1. What open source tools are you currently working with? 

Our infrastructure is based on [W3C
Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) ;standards and on thesauri,
gazetteers, and data sources already in use in Finland. At the moment we
use, e.g.,[Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) [Fuseki](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/), and
[
Varnish](https://www.varnish-software.com/)
&nbsp;for the &ldquo;7-star&rdquo;
[Linked Data
Finland](http://www.ldf.fi/) data service and
[ONKI
Light](http://light.onki.fi/fi/) [Skosmos](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Skosmos
)&nbsp;for ontology services, [Silk
](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/silk/)and [Sieve
](http://sieve.wbsg.de/)for data aligning,[Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_0_3/fileformats.html)&nbsp;for data indexing and searching, [YASGUI for SPARQL](http://laurensrietveld.nl/yasgui/)&nbsp;querying, [protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/)&nbsp;for ontology editing, LODE and
[vocab.at](http://vocab.at/)&nbsp;for dataset documentation, and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), and [Sgwizler](http://dev.data2000.no/sgvizler/)&nbsp;for
user interfaces and visualizations.

### 2. What open source tools have you used in the past to develop larger applications? 

There are also quite a few Open Source tools that we have used in larger
applications before, such as [Cocoon](https://github.com/nathanvda/cocoon), [Spring](http://spring.io/), and [Tapestry
](http://tapestry.apache.org/)&nbsp;as web development frameworks, and [SWI
Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/)&nbsp;for logic programming.

### 3. What are you currently developing? 

 On the tooling side, the [SeCo
Lexical Analysis Service](http://demo.seco.tkk.fi/las/)&nbsp;combines various open
source language technology tools into a web service, and [SPARQL
SAHA](http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/eswc2014pd_submission_46.pdf)&nbsp;makes use of them for automatic annotation
and data curation. Aether is a tool for analyzing Linked Data dynamics,
[
csv2whatever](https://github.com/rvagg/csv2)&nbsp;is a tool for data transformations,
and [Snapper ](https://github.com/jiemakel/snapper)is a browser-based Turtle
editor.

For linked data and ontology
creation, publishing, and reuse, the Linked Data Finland platform is
being developed further and is combined with various tools for a
comprehensive Linked Data publishing service.

Application prototypes being developed at the moment
include [Semantic National
Biography](http://www.seco.tkk.fi/publications/)&nbsp;for enriching and linking over 6300 of
short life stories on the Semantic Web,[&nbsp;Semantic Finlex](http://www.ldf.fi/dataset/finlex)&nbsp;for publishing and using
Finnish legislation as a Linked Data service, and WarSampo for
publishing historical datasets as Linked Data related to WW1 and WW2. We
collaborate with historians in Stanford University, University of
Oxford, and Colorado University Boulder regarding representing and
visualizing history as Linked Data.

### 4. What would you like to see developed?

The Web of Data, based on RDF and complicated
semantics, requires collaboration and mutual agreements and standards
between data publishers and users. When one creates data, one should
also think, how it will link with the other parties&rsquo; data around,
otherwise problems will arise later. Problems, that could have been
prevented by collaboration and using a shared Semantic Web
infrastructure and services. Albert Einstein&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent
them&rdquo;&nbsp;has been a motto in our work, aiming
creating a sustainable, cross-domain Semantic Web infrastructure and
applications in Finland, compatible with international
developments.
