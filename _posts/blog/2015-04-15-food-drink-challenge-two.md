The Europeana Food and Drink Project is launching a competition for representatives from the Creative Industries, start-ups, and non-profit organizations from all EU member states. With the Challenge, we invite movie and video makers to create a **video story**, of **max. 21 minutes length**, showcasing the relation between **sustainability of food and drink heritage** and **production**. Inspired and supported by [Slow Food](http://www.slowfood.com/sloweurope/en/), the focus is on aspects of biodiversity and sustainability reflected in European food and drink cultural heritage. 

The Second Open Innovation Challenge is based on a combination of three factors: 

- Pioneering **innovative strategies** and **quality standards** in video storytelling
- Promoting **linkage** of cultural heritage and sustainable food / small food production
- Improving **methodologies for collaboration** between Europeana and Creative Industries in the creation and re-use of digital content

We **challenge you** to immerse yourself in the rich variety of the Europe’s regional food and drink culture, traditions, production and sustainability and to create a meaningful story from there. We **encourage** you to get involved with regional heritage centres and local libraries, archives or museums in order to find out interesting facts, figures and records to enrich your story with significant content or simply make use of the digital content available through Europeana. [Europeana Labs](http"//labs.europeana.eu/) highlights open content and provides extensive documentation on using the Europeana API, giving you access to hundreds of thousands of items for you to incorporate into your work. All films that fulfil the evaluation criteria will be made available in the Europeana platform. 

The winning project will receive €3,000 in cash, and, this time, we’re offering more than just a cash prize as we will open up an international stage to present the best projects we receive. Selected videos will be presented in the Challenge Award Event on 22nd July 2015 at the Expo 2015 in Milan. 

The Challenge opens on **15th April 2015** and your video projects can be submitted until **20th June 2015**.
