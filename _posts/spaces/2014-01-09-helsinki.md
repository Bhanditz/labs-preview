FabLab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop for digital fabrication, started by MIT. In a Fablab you can find machines such as the lasercutter, vinyl cutter, desktop CNC milling machine and 3D printer and electronics prototyping equipment.

FabLabs aim to make this equipment available to everyone, not just students of art, design and engineering - we will host Open Days every week. Just bring your design idea along!
