The Future Classroom Lab in Brussels is a fully equipped, reconfigurable, teaching and learning space developed by [European Schoolnet](http://eun.org), its 30 supporting Ministries of Education and leading educational technology providers.

It has been designed as a “Living Lab’ for how ICT can be implemented in schools and where policy makers, ICT suppliers, teachers and educational researchers can come together to:

* Rethink how new technologies can support the educational reform process at both national and European level.
* Engage in regular workshops, seminars and courses on how existing and emerging technologies can have a transformative effect on teaching and learning processes.
* Develop new economic models in order that teaching and learning activities designed for the future classroom can be mainstreamed and taken to scale.

Results from a ‘family’ of related European Schoolnet projects, such as iTEC and CPDLab projects will particularly be made available and sustained as part of the Future Classroom Lab initiative.
