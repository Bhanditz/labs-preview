**Pundit** – [Pundit](http://www.thepund.it/) is an open source semantic annotation tool developed by [Net7](http://www.netseven.it) allowing users to create structured data annotating the web. Pundit not only enables users to annotate Web pages in various ways (comments, citations, boo kmarks…) but also to convert these annotations into semantically structured data that can be later integrated to the "Semantic Web".

The framework to represent the annotations is based on the [Open Annotation model](http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/). The ability to express semantic relationships between resources relies on the use of ontologies and vocabularies (such as Freebase.com and Dbpedia.org) that can be configured according to the needs of the communities using Pundit. The re-use of resources already available on the web provides solutions to multilinguality or disambiguation related challenges. In Pundit each annotation is described by data structured in RDF which connects the annotated object (a manuscript, a video…) to other objects or entities available as Linked Data. Semantic relationships based on URIs are created between the different entities identified in a given web page. Pundit stores annotations on an RDF based server which exposes APIs to consume annotations along with their structured content.

Pundit is also a collaborative platform which allows users to team up during the annotation creation process, to share their results and also re-use annotations created by other users. It therefore participates in the dialogue between scholars and in the creation of new knowledge. For more technical details on Pundit, see [http://www.thepund.it/publications/](http://www.thepund.it/publications/).

The [DM2E](http://dm2e.eu/) (Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana) project further develops Pundit in the context of humanities research based on the Europeana content and metadata. Users are now able to annotate and contextualise their objects by using the Europeana content and metadata. You can test the demos and install the bookmarklet at [http://www.thepund.it/](http://www.thepund.it/).
