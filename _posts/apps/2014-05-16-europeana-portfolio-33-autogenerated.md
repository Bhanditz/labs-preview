This prototype is based on a combination of SCAM framework (EntryStore) and Confolio (EntryScape) and allows the creation of online learning resources using Europeana metadata.

Users can search in the Europeana collections via a Confolio interface and add metadata from the individual search result to their online portfolio for further annotation with educational metadata.
