The Secret Legacy is the Europeana Creative Natural History Education Pilot.

*It's late in the evening when Sara makes a discovery while sorting some old documents in the basement of the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin. She finds an old folder with documents from Alexander von Humboldt and decides to unveil the secret behind it. Sara has to solve many different puzzles and to collect different items. For every solved puzzle she gets another hint. At the end of chapter one Sara gets the last hint points to the Národní muzeum in Prague. Sara decides to travel to Prague to disclose the mystery.*

"The Secret Legacy" is a mix of a point-and-click adventure and a hidden object game. The user takes the role of a museum's employee who has to solve a lot of puzzles to unveil a big secret. The story is divided into two chapters. The location for the first chapter is at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin, the location for the second chapter will be the Národní muzeum in Prague. The serious game is developed by exozet Berlin as a mix of fun and educational elements. Items from Europeana are integrated in the game, including links back to the Europeana portal.  

The storyline is linear, so the user needs to solve an active puzzle before he or she can continue with the next one. The user will receive the hints from npcs (non-player-character) or as monologues from Sara. He or she will also get additional information to locations and objects, which can be accessed through the tablet in the HUD (head-up display). While playing the game, the user will learn on various levels about natural history, science, museum's tasks and much more.
