**ECLAP Linked Open Graph** &ndash;[The Linked Open Graph](http://www.eclap.eu/116088)&nbsp;has been developed by the project [ECLAP](http://www.eclap.eu/), the e-library for performing arts. ECLAP provides Europeana with a variety of performing-arts resources such as videos of dance rehearsals, dance, theatre performances, animations, playlists. The Linked Open Graph allows users to see, explore and browse the relationships among the ECLAP content and other types of resource created on the ECLAP platform.

These resources consist of:

* Information about the creator of the resource (i.e. the creator of the content or the user who uploaded the content)

* Taxonomies: each piece of content is associated with a term from the ECLAP Classification system.

* Groups and thus content providers and thematic groups in ECLAP.

* Collections: users have the possibility to create collections by using the ECLAP content.

* Annotations: Users can create annotations on the ECLAP platform thanks to the [MyStory Player tool](http://www.eclap.eu/3748)

* Publications: to connect user that published the content

* Related objects: objects that are similar according to the current ECLAP metric used among similar by text and similar by content

* Location: [associated locations](http://www.eclap.eu/drupal/?q=it/home/location#axoid=urn:axmedis:00000:obj:09ccb06c-2b74-4382-9e0c-9ba7758cc099) identified as Linked Open Data viaGeonames, allowing the navigation into the structure of the structure of the Geonames entities

* And other resources related to social media such as comments, favourites &hellip;

* These resources are organised as a RDF graph where each resource is represented by a node. The relationships between the nodes are also represented in the graph and the user can navigate in the graph deciding of expanding each node or putting at the center of the navigation the node he prefers. The Linked Data Graph is featured in association with a media player displaying or playing the content which give rise to the graph.

* It can be easily used ad general tools for navigating in Linked Open Data, such as DBpedia: [http://log.disit.org/service/](http://log.disit.org/service/) as well as visualising Europeana &#39;s content as Linked Open Data : ([Try here](http://log.disit.org/service/index.php?uri=http://data.europeana.eu/proxy/provider/2022105/F5F8F40DCA36E201A24D84E0D11BD3563A63193A&amp;sparql=http://europeana.ontotext.com/sparql)). The Linked Open Graph visualizer has the potential to be embedded into any web pages.

The **Social Graph** is a simplified version of the Linked Open Graph for social networks. It proposes a new approach for navigation within content and related resources and also improves social interaction between users of the ECLAP platform. It can be enriched using the content directly created or generated by users of the ECLAP platform.
