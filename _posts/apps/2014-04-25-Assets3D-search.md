**ASSETS 3D search** - The ASSETS 3D search demo allows users to search for 3D models that are similar to a returned search query. In this demonstrator, users can search among 300 3D models from the Google 3D Warehouse using one model as a template for finding other models similar to it. This is made possible by analysing and indexing the shape of each 3D model and using the index as a basis for search.

From a technical perspective, the similarity between the 3D models is based on a view-based, low-level feature extraction algorithm, designed and implemented by CERTH-ITI ([www.iti.gr](http://www.iti.gr/)). The indexing is developed by ISTI-CNR ([http://www.isti.cnr.it/](www.isti.cnr.it)) and is an inverted file-based indexing. This indexing method is highly scalable and will support the indexing of thousands of 3D models.
