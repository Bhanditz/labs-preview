Culture Collage is developed by Monique Szpak (@zenlan) and started as a simple exercise in mashing up a few web technologies, including those of Europeana API.

Monique writes: "The Europeana API proved to be easy to use and provides access to over 18 million images, which makes it perfect for a very visual application and has the added advantage of being able to connect the user to both famous and obscure collections and sources."

Searches for a specific keyword result in [a stream of related Europeana images](http://zenlan.com/collage/europeana/#bicyclette "Search Culture Collage for images matching bicyclette on Europeana"). Clicking on an image lets you save it to a scrapbook and you can also hop over to the objectâ€™s page on the Europeana portal. Searches can be tweeted and search terms are preserved in the URL ready to be shared anywhere.

Monique has also developed [Culture Collage apps for the Microsoft Office suite](culture-collage-MS-Office/).
