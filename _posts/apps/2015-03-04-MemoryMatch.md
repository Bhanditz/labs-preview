Memory Match – Natural History Edition, is an educational game combining the classic memory game of finding pairs with a quiz game testing player’s knowledge of natural history.

It is one of the pilot applications developed in the Europeana Creative project - a European project enabling and promoting greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by creative industries. The goal of this project was creating an educational game that will be reusing content from Europeana. The application was developed by Semantika in collaboration with the National Museum in Prague. The game is primarily aimed at school children and their teachers and parents.

The pilot app only uses preselected content. Content with high quality images was supplied by the Natural History Museum in Prague and was selected from several preselected topics such as Fossils, Minerals and Butterflies. MyEuropeana is used to preselect content, which is already in Europeana.
 
The complete application code is available on GitHub: [github.com/semantikaeu/memorymatch/](https://github.com/semantikaeu/memorymatch/) enabling programmers to reuse and expand upon it.
