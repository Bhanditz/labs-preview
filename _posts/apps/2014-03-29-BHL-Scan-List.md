**BHL Scan List** - A tool to co-ordinate scanning efforts across biodiversity heritage organisations.

BHL-Europe and BHL member institutions can work together to improve their scanning efforts using this tool. It is based on the Biodiversity Heritage Library Serials Union Catalogue, developed at [NHM London](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/) for the [BHL project](http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/).

Currently, there are over 85,000 records of serials relevant to the biodiversity community in the BHL Scan List. The database will be continuously expanded to also include monographs from [BHL-Europe](http://www.bhl-europe.eu/) libraries.

The BHL Scan List provides an overview of shared and existing serials and monographs, can be used to identify duplicate records, and helps in the co-ordination of the digitisation process.

All users can browse and search the BHL Scan List. For proposing items to be scanned, a valid account is required that will be given to BHL and BHL-Europe member institutions on request.
