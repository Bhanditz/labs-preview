**MIMO-DB: MIMO Aggregator BackOffice** - The MIMO-DB was developed as part of the [MIMO Project](http://www.mimo-project.eu/) (Musical Instrument Museums Online). This service is used by all partners to monitor the harvesting and enrichment of their metadata. It allows for multilingual search. The MIMO-DB is a professional front-end to an XML database using the new [LIDO](http://www.lido-schema.org/) museum metadata model.

MIMO-DB features:

* OAI harvesting management
* metadata enrichment before ingestion, i.e. linking automation to:
	** instrument keywords
	** instrument makers authorities
	** geographical locations using [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/)
	
* enrichment &lsquo;monitoring&#39; using reports
* search and retrieval of [LIDO](http://www.lido-schema.org/)-based musical instruments records

See the [MIMO-DB](http://194.250.19.151/mimo/infodoc/) prototype.
