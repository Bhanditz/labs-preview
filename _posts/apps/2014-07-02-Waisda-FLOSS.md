**Waisda?** - A prototype Dutch-language game site which explores the social tagging of video in the cultural heritage domain.

Waisda? is a crowdsourcing video annotation software that introduces gaming as a way of encouraging users to add tags to cultural heritage content.

People are invited to watch the videos on the site and describe what they see and hear. They earn points for each tag and compete against other users in real time or against a pre-recorded session. Tags that match each other score higher, as do tags that provide a greater level of detail than generic terms.

Through this unique approach, Waisda? has added 350,000 tags to its content within a period of 7 months. It has also introduced 3 innovations:

* Using gaming as a method to annotate television heritage;
* Actively seeking collaboration with communities connected to the content;
* Using curated vocabularies as a means to integrate tags with professional annotations.
