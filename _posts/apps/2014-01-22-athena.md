ATHENA is a project developing metadata exchange standards for the museum domain and aggregating museum content for Europeana. Through our API, they have built a [search service](http://www.athenaeurope.org/index.php?en/191/europeana-opensearch) where users can perform keyword searches and structured searches to find and view Europeana items.

Example: search for the famous photographer, Man Ray
