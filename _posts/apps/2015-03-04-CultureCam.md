## Culture Cam

The Culture Cam (http://culturecam.eu) tool offers a non-text based visual search interface to European cultural heritage. People can browse a sub collection of Europeanaâ€™s content in an easy and intuitive way through a colour, a shape or a pattern by using camera from a computer or a mobile phone. Culture Cam enables and engages creative people and industries with European digital cultural heritage to find inspiration and source materials for new designs and art artefacts. All pictures in Culture Cam are under public domain, meaning that all the copyrights are waived or expired.

The code of Culture Cam (back-end) is open source and available via the following links: 
https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Creative/ 
https://github.com/europeana/Europeana-Creative/tree/master/image-similarity 
 
Culture Cam is developed by the Danish Design Company [Spild ad Tid](http://www.spildaftid.dk/) in collaboration with Aalto University ARTS and The Austrian Institute of Technology.
 
## About the Design Pilot

### Redesign your cultural heritage!

The Europeana Creative Design Pilot connects Europeana content to designers, artists and practitioners who wish to use digital cultural heritage as a source for new derivative designs and artworks. The pilot aims to facilitate creative processes and practices of design communities by developing tools, organizing workshops and sharing knowledge through experiments and examples.

The Design pilot operates in three main areas:

* We develop an advanced search mechanism to support various types of visual search (e.g. shape and colour).

* We facilitate hands-on workshops and events, in which participants can explore and experiment with the open digital cultural heritage made accessible via Europeana, and create new works together.

* We create experiments to stimulate and inspire designers, artists and practitioners to creatively re-use our shared culture. Outcomes, findings and good practices are shared at (http://redesignyourculturalheritage.eu/).
