The Europeana Open Culture app lets users explore hand-picked and beautiful image collections from some of Europe's top cultural institutions. They can browse, share and download for free more than 350,000 high-resolution images from four themes: Maps and Plans, Images of the Past, Treasures of Art and Treasures of Nature.

The users can start their search by entering a keyword in the search field (in any language!) or by selecting one of the 'badges' on the search page which represent entry points to the four themes. To narrow further the search, they use the in-theme filters in the left-hand menu.

All relevant results will be shown as an interactive mosaic of image thumbnails which continuously refreshes by scrolling. Users tap a thumbnail to view the image in full resolution and can find out more about it by reading image's card or connecting to other relevant web pages for more context. They can also comment on the image and read other users' impressions; add the image to their favourites; share it on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest; or create their own personal virtual museum on their topic of interest.

The app is available in seven languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Bulgarian, and Swedish) and for all Apple and Android tablets.

Europeana Open Culture is an open source app. Anyone can re-use the code - see [https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki] (https://github.com/europeana/openculture/wiki "Europeana Open Culture on GitHub") - and build their own app.
