**EFG Metadata Editor** - A tool to add, edit and delete records from a federated repository.
[The European Film Gateway](http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/) Metadata Editor allows the editing, addition or deletion of metadata records in the federated EFG repository.

In combination with the Authority File Manager, it aims to establish references between records containing links to digital resources and EFG Authority Files (mainly film works and people) in the common European Filmography Registry. Relationships can be established between records coming from just one data provider or several data providers.

This tool has been developed by the Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie dell&#39;Informazione &#39;A. Faedo&#39; of the Italian National Research Council (ISTI-CNR), based on requirements written by the German Film Institute. It is designed to be compatible with metadata schemas other than the EFG format.
