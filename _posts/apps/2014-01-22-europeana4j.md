europeana4j is a Java library which allows applications to search and retrieve Europeana data, including millions of books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe.

The library provides a clean Java interface to the Europeana Search API, with JavaBeans encapsulation, transparent pagination of results and utilities to copy and verify thumbnails.
