**EuropeanaConnect Geoparser** - A tool to extract place names from text.

This tool works with the EuropeanaConnect Gazetteer.

EuropeanaConnect Geoparser enables users to enter unstructured or partially-structured text such as metadata records and then receive a list of geographic features that are referred to in them. The results can be returned as XML or HTML.

See the [EuropeanaConnect Geoparser Prototype](http://europeana-geo.isti.cnr.it/geoparser)
