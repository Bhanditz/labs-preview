**Europeana 4D**

The amount of online services supplying geo-spatial and temporal metadata has grown rapidly in recent years. 
Search engines like Europeana, but also social networks like Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube, are popular providers of masses of data. 
The Europeana 4D interface &ndash; e4D &ndash; enables comparative visualisation of multiple queries and supports data annotated with time span data. 
We implemented our design in a prototype application in the context of the European project [EuropeanaConnect](http://www.europeanaconnect.eu/). 
It is based on a client-server architecture that charges the client with the main functionality of the system. Researchers, data-journalists, and the broad public alike can use this open source framework to explore complex data &ndash; answering both time and space-related issues.
