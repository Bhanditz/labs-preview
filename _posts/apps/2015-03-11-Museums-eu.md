Museums.EU describes itself as "The European Museums Network intended to present and promote museums and cultural heritage across Europe".

The site is a comprehensive resource for exploring Europe's cultural heritage collections. This ever growing site contains information about thousands of museums, plus events, activities, and collections. They also pull together and write their own extensive articles ranging from museums news to daily art features.

For museums that have content in Europeana, live API calls pull in top content and also allow users to search within it, such as in this example showing [pictures of women in the collections of the National Art Museum of Catalonia](http://museums.eu/collection/details/2147483647/754?pKeyword=woman).
