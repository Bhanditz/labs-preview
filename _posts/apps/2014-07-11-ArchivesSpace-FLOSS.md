A next-generation archives management application that will incorporate the best features of Archivistâ€™s Toolkit (AT) and Archon. The project team is developing a technical platform, governance structure, and service model that will provide the archival community with a cutting-edge, extensible, and sustainable platform for describing analog and born-digital archival materials. The ArchivesSpace product is being developed using an Agile scrum process, guided by a Product Vision for ArchivesSpace.
