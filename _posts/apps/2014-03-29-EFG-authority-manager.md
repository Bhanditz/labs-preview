**EFG Authority File Manager**- A tool to create unique records for people, organisations and film works.

The European Film Gateway(http://www.europeanfilmgateway.eu/)(EFG) is laying the groundwork for a common European Filmography Registry that will uniquely identify entities such as people, organisations and film works. This is known as a &lsquo;Film Authority File&#39;.

EFG is developing an Authority File Manager, which will help resolve the issue of duplication between people, organisations and films that arises when records are combined from various data providers into the common EFG metadata repository.

The Authority File Manager identifies duplicates by automatically comparing records gathered from European film archives and cin&eacute;math&egrave;ques. When duplicates are found, they are merged into one authoritative record or they are marked as being unidentical.

This tool adopts basic concepts, which have successfully been used by librarians, for the film domain. It is also designed to be compatible with metadata schemas other than the EFG format.

Work to develop this tool is being done by the Istituto di Scienze e Tecnologie dell&#39;Informazione &lsquo;A. Faedo&#39; of the Italian National Research Council (ISTI-CNR), based on requirements written by the German Film Institute.
