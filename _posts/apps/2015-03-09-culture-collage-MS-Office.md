The Culture Collage MS Office App allows easy embedding of images, together with their associated descriptions and license information, directly into documents such as Powerpoint presentations.

It was developed by Monique Szpak (@zenlan) who also developed the related [Culture Collage website](culture-collage/) where users can explore Europeana collections alongside other providers such as DPLA and Trove.
