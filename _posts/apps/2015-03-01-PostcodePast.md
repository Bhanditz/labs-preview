The aim of the PostcodePast prototype is three-fold:

- allow people to discover cultural heritage content in their neighbourhood

- use their local knowledge to put things on the map

- create an open repository of crowdsourced geotags that others can then use

For the first aim, this is primarily about surfacing content that is not geotagged (which as we know is the majority of cultural heritage content!) and also to verify any locations that have been set (for example through automated enrichment).

For the second aim, the point is to keep it really simple - everything is automatically put on the map in a tentative location and users simply have to confirm, move or reject.

And for the final aim, all the crowdsourced data that is captured is available as a very simple geoJson feed ([example feed for Oxford area](http://postcodepast.com/data/pinned.php?bbox=-1.2678909301757812,51.748660840922504,-1.2479138374328613,51.75570118786657))
