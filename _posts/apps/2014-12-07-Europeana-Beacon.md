Europeana Beacon was the winner of the [Apps for Europe](http://www.appsforeurope.eu/) award at [Hack4Pisa](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hack4pisa-registration-12152387117), Octber 2014.

The Europeana Beacon (eBe) iOS App is a new way of thinking about tourist guides. It puts a real-time, proximity driven system right into the hands of users, leveraging the potential of iBeacons technology with the Europeana's extensive database. By placing a beacon near a specific point of interest, the app can determine the user position in a town square as well as in a museum room or large exhibit, always displaying the correct information about the work of art theyâ€™re facing. Users can discover new facts, engage in fun puzzles and quizzes to explore the surroundings, while museum curators or the local tourism bureau can have a deep insight about what people really visited.
