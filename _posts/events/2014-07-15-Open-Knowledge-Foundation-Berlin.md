b.      Tools – topics include non-profit technology, open source software, open hardware, design, architecture and urban planning
c.      Society – with sessions around designing institutions, building communities, protecting environments, powering economies through open government, transparency, security, privacy, open tech businesses, open development, open education, open culture, open sustainability and open economy
