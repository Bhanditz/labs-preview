Apps&Cultura has teamed up with Europeana Creative for this year’s Hack at Home competition, an exciting new European project which enables and promotes greater re-use of cultural heritage resources by Europe’s creative industries.  By using the Europeana API we want to encourage people to re-use Europe’s digitised cultural heritage in innovative and creative ways! We’re currently looking for innovative applications that re-use Europeana content on the themes of Tourism & Social Networks.

The team from Europeana will be organising a hands on workshop demonstrating how to use the Europeana API and include it in your applications. If you have an idea for a great application but are a little overwhelmed by what Europeana content you could use, how to access it, or maybe the usage restrictions then this is the workshop for you!

### Agenda
- Welcome & Introduction (17.00 - 17.20)
- Showcasing Europeana content (17.20 - 17.30)
- Barcelona specific datasets (17.30 – 18.00)
- Europeana Api (18.00 – 18.20)
- Questions & Answers (18.20 - 18.45)
- Networking (18.45-20.00)

Before the workshop, why not explore [Europeana Labs](/) so you can familiarise yourself with what is currently available and come prepared with questions relating to the Europeana API & specific data sets you’re looking for. 

Meanwhile don’t hesitate to [contact us](/support/contact/) if you have any questions or need additional support to access the data you need.
