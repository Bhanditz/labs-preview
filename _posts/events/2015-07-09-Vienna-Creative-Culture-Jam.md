Europeana Creative Culture Jam is the final showcase event of Europeana Creative, a groundbreaking project that explores ways for creative industries to connect with cultural heritage.

Culture Jam will mix inspiring keynote talks with lively discussion on topics ranging from copyright to co-creation and from living labs to business models. We’ll celebrate our innovation Challenge winners, play with the fantastic apps the project has developed and participate in some live crowd-funding madness!

Everyone with a creative, practical or strategic interest in open data, cultural heritage or digital culture is invited to join us at the Austrian National Library.
