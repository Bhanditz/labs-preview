To start using the OAI-PMH Service, you need to have an access key. Please note this is not the same as the API key for the REST API. Please send an email to api@europeana.eu to request an access key for the OAI-PMH Service.

The access key needs to be used for the authentication, for which the service has implemented basic HTTP authentication.
