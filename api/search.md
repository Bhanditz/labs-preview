## Request

| Parameter | Datatype | Description |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-----|
| query | String | The search term(s). See [Query Syntax](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/query) for information on forming complex queries and examples. |
| profile | String | Profile parameter controls the format and richness of the response. See [the possible values of the profile parameter](#the-possible-values-of-the-profile-parameter). |
| qf | String | Facet filtering query. This parameter can be defined more than once. See [Query Syntax](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/query) page for more information. |
| rows | Number | The number of records to return. Maximum is 100. Defaults to 12. |
| start | Number | The item in the search results to start with. The first item is 1. Defaults to 1. |
| callback| String| Name of a client side [callback function](#callback_function).|

### The possible values of the profile parameter

We have two profile types: one to control which fields of the record should be in the result, and the other to control other data elements of the result.

| Value | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| minimal | Returns minimal set of metadata. See [metadata sets](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/#metadata_sets). |
| standard | Returns a boarder set of metadata. See [metadata sets](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/#metadata_sets). |
| rich | Returns the broadest set of metadata. See [metadata sets](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/#metadata_sets). |
| facets | Information about [facets](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/repository/#facets) is added. For the records the Standard profile is used. |
| breadcrumbs | information about the query is added in the form of [breadcrumbs](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/#breadcrumb). Facets are added as well; for the records the Standard profile is used. |
| params | The header of the response will contain a params key, which lists the requested and default parameters of the API call. |
| portal | `standard`, `facets`, and `breadcrumb` combined, plus additional fields over `standard` metadata set.  See [metadata sets](http://labs.europeana.eu/api/search/#metadata_sets). |

## Metadata sets

## Callback Function
Name of a client side (JavaScript) callback function. If you set a funtion the JSON response will be wrapped by this function call, so it is not JSON, but [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) (JSON with Paggings). JSONP provides a method to request data from a server in a different domain, something prohibited by typical web browsers because of the [same origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy).

> "Under the same origin policy, a web page served from server1.example.com cannot normally connect to or communicate with a server other than server1.example.com. An exception is the HTML script element. Exploiting the open policy for script elements, some pages use them to retrieve JavaScript code that operates on dynamically generated JSON-formatted data from other origins. This usage pattern is known as JSONP. Requests for JSONP retrieve not JSON, but arbitrary JavaScript code. They are evaluated by the JavaScript interpreter, not parsed by a JSON parser." (Wikipedia: [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP))

A callback can be added to any JSON-based call by appending &callback=callbackname to the call, where the callbackname should be an existing JavaScript function existing on the client side. The API returns JSONP response, like this one:

    /api/v2/record/[record ID].json?wskey=xxxx&profile=similar&**callback=processEuropeanaSearch**

returns

    processEuropeanaSearch({"apikey":"xxxxx","action":"record.json","success":true,"statsDuration":22,"requestNumber":8,"object":{"type":"TEXT","title":["Bibliotheca Indica"],"about": "[record ID]",....}})

The JSON response is wrapped into your function, and the function use JSON as input parameter, and it immediatelly runs when it returns. In your client you have to define the callback function before you call the API. A client side example:

    <script>
    function processEuropeanaSearch(json){
       alert(json.object.title.join(', '));
    }
    </script>
    <script src="http://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/record/9200143/41CCA52E2986E491BBA631D4899768A5002C455A.json?wskey=xxxx&profile=similar&callback=processEuropeanaSearch"></script>

Of course in this example we didn't do any rocket science with the returned Europeana record, it is your turn to do some fascinating thing.
