This document describes the changes of Europeana API. The changes are grouped by new API versions. We deploy new versions of the portal and API quite regularly, but not all new versions result in changes in the interface. The API documentation always describes the current version of the API. <!-- We don't have (yet?) however API call to get the actual version, so the API users should see the date of changes.-->

## Version 2.0.14 (2015-05-01)

### Support for and inclusion of technical metadata

The API now supports technical metadata, metadata which is extracted from media files such as images. This results in new request parameters for the [search API](/api/preview-search/#request), the addition of [new facets](/api/preview-data-fields/#technical-metadata-facets) and an updated [response in the record API](/api/preview-record/#response). At the time of release, we have extracted technical metadata for a few millions of records. This number will increase gradually over the next few months.

An overview of the new API parameters:

| Parameter | Datatype | Description |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-----|
| media | Boolean | Filter by records where an URL to the full media file is present in the edm:isShownBy or edm:hasView metadata and is resolvable. Works only with 'true'. |

An overview of the new facets:

| Facet | Facet name in API | Description |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Mime-type | MIME_TYPE | The mime-type of a media file, such as image/jpeg for a JPEG file. | 
| Image size | IMAGE_SIZE | The dimensions of an image. |
| Image colour | IMAGE_COLOUR | Whether an image is a full-colour image. |
| Image greyscale | IMAGE_GREYSCALE | Whether an image is a greyscale image. | 
| Image aspect ratio | IMAGE_ASPECTRATIO | The aspect ratio of an image. | 
| Video HD | VIDEO_HD | Whether a video file can be classified as an HD-video. | 
| Video duration | VIDEO_DURATION | The duration of a video file. | 
| Sound HQ | SOUND_HQ | Whether a sound file can be classified as an HQ-sound. | 
| Sound duration | SOUND_DURATION | The duration of a sound file. |
